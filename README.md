# Twitch-Bot
A chat bot that connects to an IRC Channel. In particular it is meant to connect to irc.twitch.tv and play a betting game based on the events on the stream. Currently, it calculates odds and can remember all users for a session. It is set up to store users and their earnings using the H2 databse (or jdbc, same syntax), but functionality is not fully implemented.
